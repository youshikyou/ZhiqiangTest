# Data Engineering Case Study

## Introduction

We are a cross-functional team of data scientists, data engineers and software developers from
multiple nationalities and with diverse backgrounds. Our mission is to support data-driven decision
making in trivago's marketplace by providing end-to-end analytic tools, metrics & analyses.

A day in this job is dynamic, challenging, and never the same. We log more terabytes of raw data per
day and we are looking for someone to design and maintain the data pipelines that will enable the
resulting structured data to be as useful as possible to the analytics teams at trivago.

This assignment is designed to give you a glimpse of some of the challenges you will be facing in
this role. Please be aware there are no perfect solutions - for us, it is more important to see how
you find solutions, process your ideas and structure your thoughts.

Be creative but realistic about what is possible. We are thrilled to get to know you a bit more
through the way you solve the tasks.

## Task 1: data ingestion

As a hotel price comparison site, trivago receives hotel related data from various other companies
in the hospitality industry that place advertisements on trivago. In particular advertisers provide
trivago with a full dump of of their hotel inventory. They send their hotel list in CSV files,
daily.

Your first task is to load the CSV files into a table called trivago.advertiser_hotels. For
simplicity, you should use Hadoop/HDFS commands.

Example input files are provided in the following files:

- `/input_files/bedandBLD_master_list_20200203.csv`
- `/input_files/lookandbook_hotel_list_20200203.csv`

We would like you to satisfy the following requirements:

1. Provide the table DDL for trivago.advertiser_hotels
    - Output file name: `/solution/task1/advertiser_hotels_ddl.hql`
    - Reference link: <https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL>

2. Provide a list of commands needed or a step-by-step guide to load the data into HDFS
     - Output file name: `/solution/task1/load_advertiser_hotels.hql`
     - Reference link:
       <https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html>

The purpose of this exercise is to evaluate you familiarity with Hadoop/HDFS.

## Task 2: data integration

After preparing your data loading process for trivago.advertiser_hotels, you start receiving reports
of data pipeline issues. The issues can be classified as either file issues or analytics issues.

Your second tasks is to address the issues reported while also being able to account possible future
issues. That is: make your data pipeline more resilient.

These are the requirements:

1. To deal with the input file issues create pre-loading data quality checks for the input files
   (provided by advertisers) to check for any of the following issues.
    - Output file name: `/solution/task2/advertiser_hotels_ingestion_check.[extension]`
    - Issues to be checked:
        - Wrong format of the input files names
        - Extra comma or wrong delimiter used
        - Missing header file
        - Empty file
        - Hotel names having special characters, e.g. "DÃ¼sseldorf Hotel"
    - We are most familiar with python, but you may use the programming language that makes most
      sense for you
    - The purpose of this exercise is to understand your process for data quality checking.

2. To deal with the analytics issues provide a description for the design of the pipeline that
   addresses them and will enable analysts to easily use the data.
    - Output file name: `/solution/task2/design_proposal.txt` (if you wish to include additional
      files, such as diagrams, refer to them in this file)
    - Analytics issues:
        - Analysts would like to track the status of a given hotel over time. For example, when did
          it become active? Was it ever removed from the advertiser's inventory?
        - Multiple entries of hotels with the same name but different
          hotel_id are encountered.
        - Multiple entries of hotels with the same hotel_id but different hotel names are found.
    - You may propose the creation of additional tables (other than trivago.advertiser_hotels). In
      this case also include a brief description of their structure and purpose.
    - In this exercise we are interested in seeing how you design data pipelines.

## Task 3: data aggregations

In a different dataset, you got assigned 4 tasks to create data aggregations. These aggregations will be used by reporting and visualization teams. You will be using the tables listed below.

- `trivago.advertiser_hotels` - contains the entire active hotel inventory of advertisers. You can
  assume that the data in this table is complete and clean (e.g. no duplicates).
- `trivago.clicks` - contains all the trivago clickout events. You can assume the combination
  country+advertiser+hotel_id is a key in this table. Note: not all the hotels will receive
  clickouts.
- `trivago.bookings` - contains all the booking reservation events. You can assume the combination
  country+advertiser+hotel_id is a key in this table. Note: again, not all hotels will
  get reserved.

Sample data from each of these tables is listed below.

trivago.advertiser_hotels:

| hotel_id | advertiser |
|:--------:|:----------:|
| 5001     | 21         |
| 5001     | 22         |
| 5002     | 21         |

trivago.clicks:

| country | advertiser | hotel_id |clicks |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| US      | 21         | 5001     |100    |
| US      | 22         | 5001     |50     |
| US      | 21         | 5002     |10     |
| IT      | 22         | 5001     |5      |

trivago.bookings:

| country | advertiser | hotel_id | bookings | booking volume |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------------:|
| US      | 21         | 5001     | 10       | 1000           |
| DE      | 21         | 5002     | 1        | 200            |

These are the aggregation tasks:

1. Total number of clicks per hotel
2. Top advertiser per country in terms of booking volume
3. 2nd advertiser per country in terms of booking volume
4. Booking conversion rate (bookings / clicks) for all hotels in trivago.advertiser_hotels

In this exercise we want to see how you reason about data and how you deal with edge cases in common
aggregation operations.

For each of the aggregation tasks these are the output requirements:

- Output file name: `/solution/task3/aggregations[question_number].[extension]`
- Provide Hive or (py)Spark code
